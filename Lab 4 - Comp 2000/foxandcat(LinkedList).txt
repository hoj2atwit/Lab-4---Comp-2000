It
happened
that
the
cat
met
the
elephant
in
forest
she
thought
to
herself
He
is
clever
full
of
experience
much
esteemed
in
the
world
she
spoke
to
him
in
friendly
way
Good
day
dear
Mr
Elephant
how
you
How
is
with
you
How
you
getting
on
in
these
hard
times
The
elephant
full
of
kinds
of
looked
the
cat
from
head
to
foot
for
long
time
did
not
know
whether
he
would
give
or
not
last
he
said
Oh
you
wretched
beardcleaner
you
piebald
fool
you
hungry
mousehunter
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
Have
you
the
cheek
to
how
I
getting
on
What
have
you
learnt
How
many
do
you
understand
I
understand
but
one
replied
the
cat
modestly
What
is
that
the
elephant
When
the
hounds
following
me
I
can
spring
into
tree
save
myself
Is
that
said
the
elephant
I
master
of
hundred
have
into
the
bargain
sackful
of
cunning
You
make
me
sorry
for
you
come
with
me
I
will
teach
you
how
people
get
from
the
hounds
Just
then
came
hunter
with
four
dogs
The
cat
sprang
nimbly
up
tree
sat
down
the
top
of
it
where
the
branches
foliage
quite
concealed
her
Open
your
sack
Mr
Elephant
open
your
sack
cried
the
cat
to
him
but
the
dogs
had
seized
him
were
holding
him
fast
Mr
Elephant
cried
the
cat
You
with
your
hundred
left
in
the
lurch
Had
you
been
to
climb
like
me
you
would
not
have
lost
your
life
